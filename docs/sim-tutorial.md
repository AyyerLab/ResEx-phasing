# Tutorial - Simulated Data

Here is a step-by-step guide to phasing some simulated data. This should be the
first thing you try before attempting to work with experimental data and will
provide a jumping-off point for exploring more options which may be required
with tricky real data.

## Process map
We will use the provided `4et8_sim.ccp4` map shipped with the code. This map of a
single lysozyme molecule was made from data collected at LCLS (Boutet et al.
Science 2011). Since this is a simulation, we will generate the intensity file
also from the map. The steps to do this are:
```
$ ./process_map.sh data/maps/4et8_sim.ccp4 301 2.0 0 3.0 2.0 222
$ cp data/convert/4et8_sim-sym.raw data/merges/4et8_intens.raw
```
The `process_map.sh` script parses the CCP4 map and produces a complex-valued
volume representing the Fourier transform of the molecule and a 3D support mask,
among a few other files.

## Set up system
Now that we have created the data sources, we can set up the reconstruction.
This can be done with command line tools, but also with a GUI. Load up the gui
with the following command:
```
$ ./gui.py data/merges/4et8_intens.raw data/maps/4et8_sim.ccp4
```
You should get something like the image below: 
<a href="images/gui_sim_first.png">![GUI init screen]({{
"images/gui_sim_first.png" | relative_url }})</a>

Switch to the 'Map' tab and click 'Process Map'. Now since the map has already
been processed in the previous step, you will get a dialog box asking whether to
overwrite the output. Click 'No'.
<a href="images/gui_sim_process.png">![GUI process overwrite]({{
"images/gui_sim_process.png" | relative_url }})</a>

You can now look at teh various files created from the map including a slice
through the electron density and the support. You can also see the molecular
transform and the `222`-symmetrized version, which in this case is identical to
the intensity data.

The next step is to go back to the 'Merge' tab and click the 'Plot Merge'
button. To finish the pre-processing, click the 'Zero Outer' and 'Calc Scale'
buttons. The radii for these two steps are shown above the buttons and can be
viewed by checking the relevant 'Show' marks. If you click the file generated by
'Zero Outer', you should get something looking like this:
<a href="images/gui_sim_zero.png">![GUI zero outer]({{
"images/gui_sim_zero.png" | relative_url }})</a>

Finally, it is time to generate the configuration file which tells the program
where all the files are and what parameters are required. Go to the 'Recon' tab
and change the output prefix and the config filename as shown below. then click
'Gen Config' to generate the configuration file.
<a href="images/gui_sim_config.png">![GUI gen config]({{
"images/gui_sim_config.png" | relative_url }})</a>

## Run reconstruction
Let's now examine the config file and then phase the intensities.

```ini
[parameters]
size = 301
bragg_qmax = 0.500000
scale_factor = 1.000000
num_threads = 12
point_group = 222

[files]
intens_fname = data/merges/4et8_intens-zero.raw
bragg_fname = data/convert/4et8_sim.cpx
support_fname = data/convert/4et8_sim.supp
output_prefix = data/recon/sim

[algorithm]
# Algorithm choices: DM, HIO, RAAR, mod-DM, ER
# With beta = 1, all algorithms except ER are equivalent
# algorithm and avg_algorithm are space separated with alternating numbers and names
algorithm = 200 DM
avg_algorithm = 100 DM
beta = 1.
```
The first two files reflect the input data set, 
 * `intens_fname`: Resolution-truncated 3D intensities (`size`-cubed volume)
 * `bragg_fname`: Processed Bragg map containing a low resolution molecular
   transform
The support file is derived from the low resolution Bragg model. `bragg_qmax` is
the fraction of the edge resolution up to which the Bragg transform is read. In
this case, it goes halfway (4 A).

The `[algorithm]` section describes the phasing parameters. The algorithms are
iterative so the `algorithm` option describes what update rule must be applied
for how many iterations. After stabilizing, `avg_algorithm` describes a set of
iterations and the solution will be the average of the iterate at the end of
these steps.
